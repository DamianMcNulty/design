### Rules 
  <a name="color--body-background"></a><a name="3.1"></a>
  - [3.1](#color--body-background") Body backgrounds should always be shade of gray
	
    > Why? Colored backgrounds, even very dark grays, can easily create a strain on the eyes. For important content such as the text body of a webpage or application, it is crucial users can read and intepret the page with ease.

  <a name="color--hero-background"></a>
  - 3.2 Only use colored or gradient backgrounds on sections designed to draw the user's attention. For example, headers, heroes, call-to-action banners, etc.

  - 3.3 In most cases, use white text on any image, colored, or gradient background. 

    > Why? White-on-dark is often more aethetically appealing and easier to create variants for. Additionally, a light drop shadow can sometimes help promote the text's prominence.

  - 3.4 Never use absolute blacks. Pure, opaque black (#000) is often too harsh for most webpages. Even this article has its font color set to an opacity of 84%.

  - 3.5 Ensure colored components do not border each other. Unless the colors are very strong compliments of one another, often times the contrast of two neighboring colors can create a sense of polarization and division that breaks the flow of your page. In the case of where a navigation bar might touch a colored hero, opt for a transparent navbar background instead.
